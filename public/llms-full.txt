## About

Every habit comes with a virtual kitten. Stay focused, earn XP and coins, and watch your cat evolve. All AI runs locally on your device. Hachimi turns discipline into care — when your habits keep a virtual kitten alive and growing, skipping a day feels different.

## Core Features

### Cat Parenting System — Every habit, a unique companion

Adopt a kitten from 3 randomly generated candidates. 15 pelt patterns, 19 colors, 21 eye colors, and 6 distinct personalities. Each cat has its own personality, mood, and growth stage. As you stay consistent with your habits, your companion levels up and evolves — a living reflection of your progress.

### Focus Timer — Stay focused, earn rewards

Countdown and stopwatch modes with persistent Android foreground service. Earn XP and 10 coins per minute of focus. Smart pause and dual timer modes keep you in the zone.

### Progress Tracking — Track your growth

Weekly trend charts, 91-day activity heatmap, and paginated session history. See your progress at a glance.

### On-Device AI

AI cat chat and auto-generated diary powered by Qwen3-1.7B running locally via llama_cpp_dart. Your cats respond with personality-flavored messages — all inference happens on your device with zero cloud dependency.
