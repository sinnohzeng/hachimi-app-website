Available on Android and Google Play.

## About

Every habit comes with a virtual kitten. Stay focused, earn XP and coins, and watch your cat evolve through a fixed 4-stage growth ladder based on cumulative focus hours. Hachimi turns discipline into care — when your habits keep a virtual kitten alive and growing, skipping a day feels different. Optional AI features let your cats chat with personality-flavored messages and auto-generate daily diaries.

## Core Features

### Cat Parenting System — Every habit, a unique companion

Adopt a kitten from 3 randomly generated candidates. 15 pelt patterns, 19 colors, 21 eye colors, and 6 distinct personalities. Each cat has its own personality, mood, and growth stage. Cats evolve through a fixed 4-stage ladder (0/20/100/200 cumulative hours) independent of quest target — a living reflection of your progress. Two quest modes: unlimited (open-ended) and milestone (target hours with optional deadline).

### Focus Timer — Stay focused, earn rewards

Countdown and stopwatch modes with persistent Android foreground service. Earn XP and 10 coins per minute of focus. Smart pause and dual timer modes keep you in the zone. Multi-reminder system with up to 5 reminders per quest and 9 scheduling modes.

### Progress Tracking — Track your growth

Weekly trend charts, 91-day activity heatmap, and paginated session history. See your progress at a glance. Achievement system with 163 achievements across 4 categories, 8 titles, and coin rewards. Full-screen celebration overlay with confetti and haptic feedback.

### AI Companion — Optional cloud AI

AI cat chat and auto-generated diary powered by your choice of MiniMax M2.5 or Google Gemini 3 Flash. Your cats respond with personality-flavored messages via cloud AI providers. AI features are optional and opt-in — a privacy disclosure is shown on first enable, and you choose which provider to use. Conversation history stored locally on device via SQLite.

## Design Principles

### Attachment Motivation

Hachimi turns discipline into care. When your habits keep a virtual kitten alive and growing, skipping a day feels different.

### Privacy-First Design

All habit and focus data is stored in Firebase with strict security rules. AI features are optional and require explicit opt-in with privacy disclosure. When AI is enabled, conversation content is sent to the selected cloud provider (MiniMax or Google Gemini) for processing. Chat history is stored locally on device. Account deletion is supported with a 4-step flow.

### Offline Capable

Connectivity monitoring with graceful degradation and real-time sync. Core features (focus timer, habit tracking) work fully offline and sync when connection is restored. AI features require internet.

### Beautiful Design

Material Design 3 with dynamic theming, smooth animations, mesh gradient backgrounds, atmospheric particle effects, and attention to detail across every screen.
